# SSLresearch
sound source localization algorithm research experiments.

There are two methods I have implemented in matlab right now.
1. GCC
2. SRP-PHAT

The special requirement of my task is to analyze signals under high frequency (ultrasound,f>=20kHz)
Later, I will deploy modified SRP-PHAT on a STM32F4401RE MCU unit.
